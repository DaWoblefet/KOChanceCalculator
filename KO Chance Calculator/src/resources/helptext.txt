KO Chance Calculator, written by DaWoblefet. Special thanks to Stats for algorithm design.

This program is used to calculate the chance of a combination attack KOing a Pokemon.
Steps:
1) Input the HP stat of the target Pokemon.
2) Copy and paste the damage rolls for each of your attacks from the damage calculator. If needed, use the \"+\" or \"-\" buttons to add or remove sets of damage rolls.
3) Press Calculate.

NOTE: if you add a lot of damage rolls (like more than 5), the program may lag and run more slowly, but it's working.
